make visualization

1. (only done on init) am i in check? (from king, see who's attacking)
2. if in check:
    a. determine attackers, can be done during step 1
    b. if in double check, the king must move
    c. if in single check, the king can move, attacker can be taken, or maybe attack can be blocked (only bishop, rook, queen)
3. if not in check, still need to limit the moves of pinned pieces:
    a. iterate through enemy sights (bishop, rook, queen)
            if on the same sight as king, and there's one piece inbetween and it's friendly, then need to limit moves for that piece to only on that sight
4. determine if enemy is in check (from king, see who's attacking)

problems:
    is there a way to quickly get locations of pieces just from bitmap? possible solution is to keep a set of locations for each piece type, but this adds overhead
    is there a way to quickly generate a move limiting mask?
    is there a faster way to generate pseudo-valid moves?

todo:
    check mechanics
    pinned pieces
    castling
    promotion
    en passant


board states:
    white's turn or black's turn
    promotion prompt
    win or lose
    in check
    toggle square
    select move for square


undo move
    given start and end square, move piece back from end to start
    if the piece took a piece, move it back
    if the piece was a promotion, need to replace start square with pawn
    if the piece took away castling rights, grant them back
    if the piece did en passant, need to add a pawn back
